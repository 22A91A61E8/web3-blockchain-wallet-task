## Key Learnings

### Blockchain vs Traditional Databases
- Blockchain operates as a distributed ledger where transactions are recorded across multiple nodes
- Ensures transparency and immutability - once confirmed, transactions cannot be altered
- Unlike centralized databases where a central authority controls data

### Smart Contracts and Gas Fees
- Self-executing programs that run on the blockchain without intermediaries
- Every transaction requires gas fees to compensate validators for computational resources
- Gas mechanism prevents network spam and ensures efficient resource allocation

### Wallet Security
- Seed phrase is the master key - losing it means permanently losing access to funds
- No "forgot password" option in decentralized systems
- Complete user sovereignty but also complete user responsibility

### Transaction Lifecycle
- Transaction enters mempool → Picked up by validators → Included in block → Confirmations for finality
- Block explorers like Etherscan provide transaction verification and tracking

## Skills Demonstrated
- Blockchain wallet configuration
- Testnet navigation
- On-chain transaction execution
- Gas fee understanding
- Block explorer verification
- Wallet security best practices

## Tools Used
- **MetaMask** - Browser extension wallet
- **Sepolia Testnet** - Ethereum test network
- **Etherscan** - Block explorer
- **Sepolia PoW Faucet** - Testnet ETH provider

## Reflection
This practical exploration of Web3 technologies provided valuable insights into decentralized systems architecture. The immutability, transparency, and user sovereignty offered by blockchain come with trade-offs in transaction speed and user responsibility. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for developing secure and efficient decentralized applications.
